## üìñ Usage

All commands in this workflow are defined in a YAML configuration file. See [actions.yaml](actions.yaml) for an example.

### Step 1: Set up your repository configuration

**TBD** (You can add this section later with details on how to configure repos.yaml.)

### Step 2: Customize and Enjoy

1. **Use the default configuration:** The included [actions.yaml](actions.yaml) contains a set of pre-defined commands.  

2. **Create a personalized config file:**
   - Copy the [actions.yaml](actions.yaml) file to a directory on your computer.
   - Reference your copy in the workflow configuration to prevent it from being overwritten during updates.
   - Periodically check [actions.yaml](actions.yaml) for new features or updates.

3. **Add your own commands:**
   - Modify the inline YAML file or include additional YAML files in your configuration.
   - Define repository-specific YAML files for commands unique to certain repos.
