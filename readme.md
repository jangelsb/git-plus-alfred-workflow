## üìñ Usage

All commands in this workflow are defined in a YAML configuration file. See [actions.yaml](actions.yaml) for an example.

### Step 1: Set up your repos
```yaml
- title: Repo 1
  path: $repo_path1

- title: Repo 2
  path: "/path/to/repo2"
  actions_path: /path/to/actions.yaml

```
#### NOTE
* `actions_path` is an optional path to an actions.yaml that is only for that repo. The working directory for that path is the repo's directory.
* If you set a ‚Äúbash profile‚Äù, you can use enviroment variables for your paths, e.g, `$REPO_PATH`


### Step 2 (Optional)
1. **Use the default configuration:** The included [actions.yaml](actions.yaml) contains a set of pre-defined commands.  

2. **Create a personalized config file:**
   - Copy the [actions.yaml](actions.yaml) file to a directory on your computer.
   - Reference your copy in the workflow configuration to prevent it from being overwritten during updates.
   - Periodically check [actions.yaml](actions.yaml) for new features or updates.

3. **Add your own commands:**
   - Modify the inline YAML or include an additional YAML file in your configuration.
   - Define repository-specific YAML files for commands unique to certain repos, see `actions_path` in Step 1.
